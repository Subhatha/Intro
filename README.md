# 👋 Hey, I'm Subhatha Senanayake

I'm a programmer who loves building things that solve real problems — from sleek web apps to efficient automation tools. When I’m not deep in code, I’m probably flying a drone, capturing cinematic footage, or cutting it all together in post.

## 💻 What I Do

- 👨‍💻 **Software Development**  
  Building full-stack apps, scripting automation, and constantly learning new tech.  
  Languages: `JavaScript`, `Python`, `TypeScript`, `Go`  
  Frameworks: `React`, `Node.js`, `Next.js`, `Express`, `TailwindCSS`

- 🛠️ **Currently Working On**  
  [Optional: your current project or tech stack]  
  Or: Automating things I’m too lazy to do manually.

- 🎥 **Side Hustle: Drone Videography & Video Editing**  
  Shooting cinematic drone footage, editing with precision, and bringing stories to life visually.  
  Tools: `DaVinci Resolve`, `Premiere Pro`, `After Effects`, `DJI Drones`

## 🧠 Always Learning

- Cloud, DevOps, and scaling apps
- Better storytelling through code & visuals
- Mixing creativity with logic
